    **How this was made**

    This document was created using Docutils_/reStructuredText_ and S5_.

    This presentation has been used as an introduction to JavaScript for existing
    programmers, but is also an exploration of what makes the JavaScript language
    good and not so good. I have used it to bring skilled backend programmers (Python,
    Java, C) up-to-speed on the latest thinking in the JS community. It also includes
    some materials about Node.JS, since Node has provided a great environment for writing
    production-quality JavaScript code in a non-browser context.

    Simplicity begets elegance.
